# 🏪 Family Store Tools

Welcome to **Family Store Tools** — a collection of small Python programs I'm building to help with managing our family's store.

This repository will contain tools for handling various store-related tasks, such as:

- 📋 Customer debt tracking (Utang System)
- 📦 Inventory management
- 💰 Sales tracking
- 🧾 Receipt generation
- And more to come!

## 📁 Projects Included

### 🔹 [Utang System](./utang-system)
A simple CLI app to track customer debts, built using Python and CSV files.

### 🔹 [Inventory Tracker](./inventory-tracker)
*(Coming soon)* A program to help track inventory and stock levels.

## 💡 Why This Exists

Running a small family business involves a lot of manual work. These tools are meant to **simplify daily operations**, reduce errors, and make things easier for my family — especially with tracking sales, debts, and items.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project is in its own folder with its own README and instructions. Just navigate into a project and follow the guide to run it.
